Dashboard for all insti related activities

We're now live!! Check us out [here](http://iitm.webops.club/)


## Submit a new widget
There are two types of widget:

* Native angular widget
* Embedded external widet

If you have an idea for a new widget, make a feature request in issues. If you
are enthusiastic enough, you can build the widget yourself (make sure it is responsive)
and submit the repositiry url as a new feature.

Otherwise, you can host the application yourself and give us the url.

This will become an embedded external widget.

#### Points to note:
 - Application must be responsive following a mobile first design.
 - Must conform to overall styling of the dashboard so that the widget will not look out of place.
 - Authentication/Notification API spec has to be followed.
 - There should not be indepenedent authentication in the application while it is added as a widget in the dashboard

For builing native widgets, see [Getting started with development](#getting-started-with-development)
